suggestions for improvement:
- The `show_menu` function does not print the 'Current menu:' header as specified in the prompt.
- The `add_item` and `update_price` functions use `isdigit()` to validate the price, which doesn't allow for decimal prices (e.g., 7.50). Consider using `float()` and handling `ValueError` exceptions.
- The `run_coffee_shop` function initializes `menu` to an empty dictionary, overriding the initial data given in the prompt. It should initialize the `menu` as specified in the prompt: `menu = {"espresso": 7.0, "latte": 12.0, "cappuccino": 10.0}`.
- The prompt specified that the price is a float, but it is being cast as an Integer in the `add_item` and `update_price` functions.
- The test calls of `add_item`, `update_price` and `delete_item` are executed and print to the console. These should be removed from the final submission.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code implements the required functions and follows the program flow specified in the prompt, but there are a few key points where the implementation does not perfectly match the directions and examples. The test calls should not be in the final submission. The initial dictionary is being overwritten. The type of price is not being used correctly.
- readability: The code is fairly readable. Variable names are descriptive and function definitions have appropriate docstrings, though they are not used. There is consistent indentation, but there are missing newlines separating blocks of code. A little bit of whitespace could greatly improve the readability.
- performance: The code's performance is adequate for the given task. There are no obvious performance bottlenecks.
- security: The code does not have any major security vulnerabilities, but input validation could be more robust to prevent potential issues such as exceptions when converting user input to numbers.
