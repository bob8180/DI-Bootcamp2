suggestions for improvement:
- The code is well-structured and directly addresses all the requirements of the prompt. No changes needed.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately creates an Excel file, populates it with student data including names and grades, adds average formulas, and formats the header row with bold font and color. This perfectly aligns with all the instructions in the prompt.
- readability: The code is easy to understand, with clear comments explaining each step. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is well-formatted.
- performance: The code is efficient for the given task, which involves creating and writing to a relatively small Excel file. The use of loops is appropriate for populating the data.
- security: The code does not involve any external input or potentially unsafe operations, making it secure.
