suggestions for improvement:
- The code attempts all exercises, but the first exercise isn't fully implemented, failing to create the calculator layout. Exercise 2 and 3 requires an additional data file.
- Exercise 4 needs to generate the described chart and write data in Excel file.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code attempts all exercises. Exercise 1 partially addresses the prompt by creating and saving an Excel file and adding data, but it doesn't fully implement the specified calculator layout. Exercise 2, Exercise 3, and Exercise 4 imports the libraries and load the data, but the plots chart is not generated and written to the Excel file.
- readability: The code is generally readable, with comments explaining each major step. However, the code could be better organized by separating each exercise into its own function or file.
- performance: The code's performance is adequate for the given tasks. However, loading and saving the Excel file multiple times in Exercise 3 is inefficient.
- security: The code does not appear to have any major security vulnerabilities. However, it's good practice to avoid hardcoding file paths and to validate user inputs.
